I've used a dynamic programming approach with memoization, using a recursive function rec that takes parameters i and j to represent the current indices of boys and girls, respectively. The function also takes n and m as the total number of boys and girls, and arrays a and b containing the dancing skills of boys and girls, along with a memoization table dp. Within the rec function, if either i reaches the end of the boys' array a or j reaches the end of the girls' array b, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it recursively explores all possible pairs, considering the condition that the partners' dancing skills differ by at most one. The memoization table dp stores already computed results to avoid redundant calculations. After initializing ans with the result of rec(0, 0, n, m, a, b, dp), the code sorts the arrays a and b in non-decreasing order and prints the final result ans, which represents the largest possible number of pairs that can be formed. This approach ensures an efficient solution to the problem by systematically exploring all valid pairings while utilizing memoization to optimize performance and avoid recomputation of overlapping subproblems.
