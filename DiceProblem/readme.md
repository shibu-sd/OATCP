This C++ program calculates the number of ways to reach a certain point by making moves of at most 6 steps at a time. It iterates through test cases, each specifying a target point, and computes the total number of ways to reach that point using dynamic programming. Modulo arithmetic is applied to avoid integer overflow. Users input the number of test cases and the target points, and the program outputs the total number of ways for each test case. 

The program iterates through each test case, initializing a dynamic programming array (dp) to store the number of ways to reach each point. It traverses from 1 to the target point, updating dp based on the number of ways to reach each point by making moves of at most 6 steps at a time. To prevent integer overflow, modulo arithmetic (MOD = 1e9 + 7) is applied during computation. The program outputs the total number of ways to reach the target point for each test case. This implementation efficiently handles large target points while ensuring accuracy and preventing overflow.
