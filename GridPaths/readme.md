The provided C++ program calculates the number of paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid represented by a 2D vector of characters, utilizing dynamic programming for efficiency. It recursively computes the paths, memoizing results to avoid redundant calculations. Users input the grid size and values, with obstacles denoted by '*' and empty spaces by '.', and the program outputs the total number of paths found.

The program employs a recursive approach (rec() function) to navigate through the grid, calculating the number of paths from each cell to the bottom-right corner. It utilizes dynamic programming to optimize computation by storing already calculated values in a memoization table (dp vector). Before computing paths from a cell, it checks if the value for that cell has already been calculated; if so, it reuses the stored value, avoiding redundant calculations. This strategy significantly improves efficiency, especially for larger grids. Users input the grid size (n) and the grid itself, with obstacles represented by '*' and empty spaces by '.', after which the program outputs the total number of paths found. Contributions for enhancements, bug fixes, and optimizations are encouraged to further improve the program's functionality and efficiency, particularly for handling larger grid sizes.
